    <h1>An Exciting opportunity</h1>
    <p>A good colleague of yours has come to you with a very exciting investment opportunity. Unfortunately, you don't quite have enough money to invest. <br>
        You need to make some more money, quickly, or you will miss out! 
        You do some research online, but most of the possibilities are just too slow. You need money, fast. <br>
        A few possibilities look promising, though... You find out about a private poker game with high stakes. Or you could try your hand at escorting. They make a lot of money, right?
